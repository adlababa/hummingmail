ABOUT
=====

Humming Mail aims to become an easily customizable Postfix Administration
interface. It supports plug-ins, different SQL backend configurations.

More than any other web mail admin, Humming Mail can be extended by adding
new pages, fields, relations rules and custom look.

Humming Mail is based on Agile Toolkit which makes User Interface development
an easy job. It relies on Model-View-Controller paradygms and native AJAX
techniques.

====================
POSTFIX, CourierIMAP
====================

To use Humming Mail with Postfix, you need to store your configuration in
MySQL (or other supported database). Humming Mail allows you to have your
own database configuration and it comes with two database structures: one
is compatible with 'postfixadmin' but another uses a more compact structure
based on SQL syntax.

CourierIMAP should also be configured to use with SQL. You will find
configuration files under doc/

============
INSTALLATION
============

By Default Humming Mail uses a compact configuration of your Postfix. If
you are already running virtual mailbox setup, see "migration" section.

1. Follow Postgres Virtual email hosting howto. 
2. Create MySQL user and database
3. Use doc/*.cf files as postfix configuration. Amend them to match mysql information
4. Place current directory into webroot
5. Copy config-distrib.php into config.php and edit your database settings
6. Import doc/mailsql.sql into your database

u: admin@example.org
p: secret

Add users for other domains and change default password

==========
MIGRRATION
==========

Follow regular installation guide. Inside your "config.php" select to use
"postfixadmin" compatible database setup. You should be able to run
Humming Mail alongside PostfixAdmin on the same database.

Installing upgrades will not affect your postfixadmin tables but new
features and extensions will not be available while you are using
"postfixadmin" setup.

You can migrate users from our postfixadmin tables into the new single-table
configuration when you are ready to drop support for "postfixadmin" and
fully migrate to Humming Mail.


=========

One of the goals of Humming Mail is ability to easily customize and change
interface, database setup and add additional features.
